      <h3>Resistance calculations:</h3>
      <p>For the Capacitive touch sensor, we want a large resistance, so I went with the 1M ohm resistor. This is because we are measuring the time taken for the recieving pin to change state, and the higher the resistance, the slower it changes state, leading to more useful readings.

      <figcaption>My circuit sends a signal through a large resistor and any metal that can be used as a capacitive touch sensor, (here I used a key), and then measures the time taken to recieve the signal.
        Then a servo is connected to power, ground, and a PWM pin which writes to the servo what angle to move to. </figcaption>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <h3>1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
      for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}
      <br> Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</h3>

      <img src="A4/Question 1 Graph.png">
      <figcaption> My graph shows the voltage across the pin attached to the servo vs. time for 2 seconds.</figcaption>

    <h3> 2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
    <p>Since we are only having erroneous readings 1% of the time, we can take the measurement three times at each scan time to check that they are all consistent. Upon comparing them, if we do have an erroneous result 1% of the time, it will likely be solved for by the two other values matching.</p>
    <pre>
      long r1 = cs_4_2.capacitiveSensor(30);
      long r2 = cs_4_2.capacitiveSensor(30);
      long r3 = cs_4_2.capacitiveSensor(30); // Take three readings one after the other
  
      
      if (r1 == r2 || r1 == r3) return r1; 
      if (r2 == r3) return r2; // If two values match, return that value
  
      return (r1 + r2 + r3) / 3; //if all values are different, will return the average of all three values
    </pre>
  <br>
    <h3> 3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
    <p>Similar to the last answer, taking multiple measurements and then averaging them out could help smooth the data. However, since this is more than a 1% error I want to take more samples, with some tiny delays in between them.</p>
    <pre>
      const int numSamples = 5; // number of readings to average
      long total = 0; initializes total variable to represent summation of readings before being averaged

      for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) { // Loops to take as many readings as declared in numSamples
        total += cs_4_2.capacitiveSensor(30);  // Takes a reading and adds it to the total
        delay(5);  // Small delay between readings to reduce fluctuations
      }

  return total / numSamples;  // Return the averaged reading</pre>
