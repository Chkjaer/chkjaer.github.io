      <p>Red and Green LED: 5v Power - 1.8v drop = 3.2v = .02 Amps x Resistance</p>
      <p>Resistance = 3.2v / .02 Amps = 160 Ohms -> Use a 220 Ohm resistor</p>

      <p>Blue LED: 5v Power - 3.3v drop = 1.7v = .02 Amps x Resistance</p>
      <p>Resistance = 1.7v / .02 Amps = 85 Ohms -> Use a 100 Ohm resistor</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <h3>How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</h3>
      <p> I could blink up to 13 LEDs independently, and this would draw 20mA per LED, resulting in a total current draw of 260mA.</p>
    <h3>How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h3>
      <p> Blinking my LEDs anywhere faster than 15 ms makes it almost impossible to tell they are blinking.</p>

A1 Blink! HCDE 439

Attribution: Code is based on Blink! Example from Arduino. 
The documentation for Blink example is included here:
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
