      <h3>Resistance and Current calculations:</h3>
      <p>For the Capacitive touch sensor, we want an extremely large resistance so that our sensor is extra sensitive, so I went with the 3 x 1M ohm resistors. This is because we are measuring the time taken for the recieving pin to change state, and the higher the resistance, the slower it changes state, leading to more useful readings.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>For the Current across the transistor, we can calculate the current by considering our voltage and resistance.
        <pre>
            White LEDS ~3.3 voltage drop
            3 x 3.3 = 9.9
            Power supply 12v, so 2.1v drop across resistor
            Resistor marked 241, so 24x10=240 ohms
            2.1/240 = 0.00875A, 8.75mA per segment
            16.4 ft of LEDs with 5 segments per foot.
            16.4 ft x 5 segments x 8.75mA = 717.5 mA.
            </pre>
        <p>Therefore, 717.5mA is the max current across the transistor. 
            This is fine considering the N-MOSFET data sheet shows this transistor can handle current up to 220A.</p>

      <figcaption>My circuit sends a signal through a large resistor and any metal that can be used as a capacitive touch sensor, (here I used a key), and then measures the time taken to recieve the signal.
        Then a LED strip is connected to power and a N-MOSFET transistor that will control the current to ground, adjusting flow control from a PWM pin which writes to the transistor based on the capacitance . </figcaption>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    1: This is the datasheet for the n-mosfet transistor: https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/DMT6009LCT.pdf Links to an external site. 
    What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?
    According to this datasheet, the maximum current through the drain is 37.2 A, however the highest amount of current that can safely flow throauh a n-MOSFET's internal body diode before causing damage is 80 A.
    
    2: Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, and capacitors between power and ground. Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these schematic components.

    3: Here is the datasheet for the L293D chip: https://www.ti.com/product/L293D Links to an external site.
    Draw a schematic using at least your arduino, this chip, and two motors. Write (pseudo) code that shows how you would move the motors both forward, both back, then one forward one back, and one back then forward.
